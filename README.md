🌟 ShadowChat 🌟

ShadowChat is a secure and private messaging application designed to protect your conversations. With end-to-end encryption and ephemeral messages, your communications remain confidential and disappear after a set period, ensuring your privacy.

🔒 Secure Communication: ShadowChat employs robust encryption algorithms to safeguard all messages exchanged within the platform. Whether you're sharing sensitive information or engaging in casual conversations, rest assured that your communication is fully protected from prying eyes.

⏳ Ephemeral Messages: Say goodbye to worrying about your messages lingering indefinitely. In ShadowChat, messages have a lifespan - they vanish after a predetermined period, ensuring that your conversations remain ephemeral and leave no digital footprint behind.

💬 Intuitive Interface: ShadowChat offers a seamless and user-friendly interface, making it effortless to connect with friends, family, or colleagues. Express yourself freely knowing that your interactions are private and secure. From sharing the latest news to discussing sensitive topics, ShadowChat enables you to communicate without constraints.

✨ Complete Privacy: Your privacy is paramount in ShadowChat. There are no usernames, passwords, or personal data required. Instead, each chat is identified solely by a unique lobby code. Whether you're creating a new chat or joining an existing one, all participants are identified by this code, ensuring anonymity and discretion.

🔑 Code-Based Access: Accessing ShadowChat is straightforward - simply create a new chat or join an existing one using the lobby code provided by a friend or colleague. This streamlined approach eliminates the need for complex login procedures and minimizes the risk of unauthorized access.

📆 Automatic Data Removal: Concerned about data retention? ShadowChat automatically purges all messages, files, and media after three days. This built-in feature ensures that your conversations are transient, offering an added layer of privacy and security.
